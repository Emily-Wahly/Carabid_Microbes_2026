The diversity and composition of carabid microbiomes compared between farms managed with conventional vs organic practices.
Does the choice of organic or conventional agricultural management affect the alpha diversity of the gut microbiome of local Carabids?

It has been shown that insect gut microbiomes are affected by pesticide treatments, but the interactions are variable and of budding discussion. While the microbial degradation of pesticides may contribute to the resistance of target pests, this interaction also indicates a potential solution to the persistent nature of soil-dwelling pesticides, which endangers beneficial insects. Ground beetles of the family Carabidae are beneficial predatory ecoindicators notable in agricultural areas, and microbially-enhanced resistance to pesticides would improve their ecological outlook in conventionally-managed agricultural fields. The current investigation will determine if the gut microbiome of Carabids is altered by pesticide use while verifying the reproducibility of an established study. This preliminary understanding of the interactions between beetle-associated microbes and pesticides will inform future investigation on pesticide resistance and microbiome resiliency.

H0: there will be no significant difference in gut microbiome alpha diversity between conventional and organic fields.
H1: the Carabid gut microbiome alpha diversity will be lower in conventional fields and higher in organic fields.

I will determine the most abundant genera across field types and compare alpha diversity in the respective beetle populations. If the alpha diversity is lower in organic fields, it would not support my hypothesis; if it is lower in conventional fields, it would support my hypothesis. A supported hypothesis would indicate that pesticide use causes a decrease in microbe species richness and evenness, perhaps due to the dominance of a genera capable of pesticide degradation or resiliency, or a change in diet by the beetle causing a community shift.
Visualization strategies:
I will make box-and-whisker plots to represent the spread of relative abundance for each phylum compared between conventional and organic management. Other box-and-whisker plots can show alpha diversity indices between farms.
